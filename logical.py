#Example 1
x = 5
print(x > 3 and x < 10) # True because both conditions are True

#Example 2
y = 5
print(y > 10 and y % 5 == 0) #False bacause the second condition is False

#Example 1
x = 5
print(x < 3 and x > 10) #False because both conditions are False

#Example 2
y = 12
print(y < 10 or y % 2 == 0) #True because the second condition is True

#Example 1
x = 5
print(not(x > 3 and x < 10)) #False because the condition inside the not is True
#Example 2
y = 12
print(not(y > 10 and y % 5 == 0)) #True because the condition inside the not is false
